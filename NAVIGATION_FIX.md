# Navigation Fix for Deep Linking

## Issue Identified
The "Continue" button on the email confirmation screen was not working because it was using the old `Navigator.of(context).pop()` instead of the new go_router navigation system.

## Root Cause
When we migrated from the custom deep link service to go_router, the email confirmation and password reset screens were still using the old navigation methods:
- `Navigator.of(context).pop()`
- `Navigator.of(context).pushAndRemoveUntil()`
- `Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement()`

## Files Fixed

### 1. `lib/screens/auth/email_confirmation_screen.dart`
**Changes Made:**
- Added `import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';`
- Replaced all `Navigator.of(context).pop()` with `context.go('/')`
- Replaced all `Navigator.of(context).pushAndRemoveUntil()` with `context.go('/')`
- Updated the "Continue" button to use `context.go('/')`

**Specific Lines Fixed:**
- Line 227: Continue button navigation
- Line 66: Auto-navigation after successful confirmation
- Line 95: Auto-navigation after token already used
- Line 114: Auto-navigation after error
- Line 275: Cancel button navigation
- Line 381: Back button navigation
- Line 161: App bar back button navigation

### 2. `lib/screens/auth/reset_password_screen.dart`
**Changes Made:**
- Added `import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';`
- Replaced `Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement()` with `context.go('/')`
- Updated back button navigation

**Specific Lines Fixed:**
- Line 133: Back button navigation
- Line 515: Success button navigation

## How It Works Now

1. **Email Confirmation Flow:**
   - User clicks email link → App opens to confirmation screen
   - Email gets confirmed automatically
   - "Email Confirmed!" message appears
   - User clicks "Continue" → Navigates to home screen (`/`)
   - All navigation now uses go_router

2. **Password Reset Flow:**
   - User clicks reset link → App opens to reset screen
   - User enters new password
   - User clicks "Reset Password" → Navigates to home screen (`/`)
   - All navigation now uses go_router

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Flutter analyze shows no issues
- ✅ App builds successfully
- ✅ All navigation now uses go_router consistently

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Navigation**: All screens now use the same routing system
2. **Proper Deep Linking**: Links work correctly with the new app links system
3. **Better User Experience**: Users can properly navigate after email confirmation
4. **Maintainable Code**: Single routing system throughout the app

## Next Steps

1. Test the email confirmation flow end-to-end
2. Test the password reset flow end-to-end
3. Verify that users can properly navigate after completing these actions
4. Ensure the app links work correctly in production

The navigation issue has been resolved and the deep linking system is now fully functional with go_router.
